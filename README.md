# Computer Guided Model Rocket
Used Gyro and Accelerometer data to maintain an upright position in flight. Used fins to control its roll pitch and yaw instead of thrust vectoring. 
# Design
The first version of this rocket used an arduino nano with an MPU-6050 for orientation and acceleration data. I am very new to programming and 
chose to use an existing library from https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib this allowed me to learn the basics of arduino and C to control the servos and log data.
